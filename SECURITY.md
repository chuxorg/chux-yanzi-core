## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities privately using a GitHub Security Advisory for this repository. This is the preferred contact method and helps us coordinate a fix safely.

We encourage responsible disclosure and ask that you do not publicly disclose the issue until we have had a reasonable opportunity to review and address it. We will acknowledge receipt of reports within a reasonable timeframe and keep you informed of our progress.
